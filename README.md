MSSQL Database Project
Overview

This project demonstrates a relational database model created in Microsoft SQL Server. The database is designed to store and manage data efficiently while supporting complex queries.

Database Design

Data Model: Tables and relationships were designed to represent the real-world entities and their interactions.

Relationships: Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints were implemented to ensure data integrity.

Normalization: The database schema follows normalization principles to reduce redundancy.

Features & Queries

SQL Queries: Various queries were written to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.

Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and other join operations were used to combine data from multiple tables.

Sample Outputs: The project includes example query results to demonstrate the functionality of the database.

Tools Used
